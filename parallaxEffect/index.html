              Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as

              and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top
              fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by
              finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D.
              Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most
              freedom in the world

              Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is the combatant
              of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their two swordsmen. Formerly
              a bounty hunter, he is the second member of the crew and the first
              to join, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc. As a master of
              Santoryu, a swordsmanship style which he created during his
              childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the four
              most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy, Sanji
              and Jinbe. His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the
              world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased
              childhood friend Kuina.

              after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-m√®re. She was
              formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the
              Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to buy back her
              village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw
              Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is
              to make a map of the entire world.

              the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus making
              him a prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice,
              once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.
              After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the
              care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would
              remain until he met Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
